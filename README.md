 ## Automate Games using OpenCV and PyAutoGUI Library
 ### This is going to be an upcoming project about automating games with python libraries and packages
 ### At its core, this project's PyAutoGUI Library is used to take control of the mouse and the keyboard.
 ### The OpenCV library is used for computer vision to detect hand/facial gestures

 ### These two python library/package are integrated in this project in such a way that for certain gestures detected by OpenCV(or CVzone) are then used to decide what action in terms of  pressing any key or taking control of the mouse will take place by the help of PyAutoGUI package.

 #### For example, if the CVzone library detects the hand gesture is a closed fist then it might press 'up' key on the keyword or something similar according to how it is programmed
